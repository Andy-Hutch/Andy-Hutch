Conducted a simulated internal risk assessment for a fictional organization, establishing a structured process to identify, score, and prioritize IT and business risks. Developed a dynamic risk register using a likelihood and impact scoring model, with conditional formatting to visually communicate risk levels. Included documentation of mitigation strategies, ownership, and status tracking to support ongoing risk management efforts.
