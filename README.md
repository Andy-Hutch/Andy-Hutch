## 🔐 What I Do

- Monitor and triage security alerts using SIEM tools (Splunk, Elastic Stack) to detect and investigate threats
- Analyze phishing campaigns, malware activity, and ransomware incidents to support incident response
- Escalate confirmed incidents to L2 analysts, CERT, or SOC engineers, providing detailed evidence and context
- Investigate endpoint, network, and server logs to identify suspicious activity and patterns
- Document incidents, alert resolution, and workflow improvements for audits and team knowledge
- Collaborate with SOC team members to optimize detection rules and streamline response processes
