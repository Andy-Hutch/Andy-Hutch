# 🔒 SOC Analyst Portfolio — Detection, Triage & Incident Response

Hands-on SOC labs focused on SIEM alert triage, phishing and malware analysis,
incident response workflows, and security automation.

Each repository demonstrates real analyst tasks:
alert investigation, evidence collection, escalation decisions, and documentation.

This portfolio focuses on practical SOC analyst workflows built through
hands-on labs and simulated security incidents, including alert triage,
log analysis, phishing investigation, and incident response documentation.
