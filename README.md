# 👋 Hi, I'm Andy Hutchison

I'm transitioning into **cybersecurity with a focus on GRC** (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) after graduating from Merit America and earning my Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

---

### 🔐 What I Do

- Build security policies and conduct internal audits aligned with NIST and CIS controls
- Create basic GRC reports, riskk registers, and third-party risk evaluations
- Develop security awareness content and phishing simulations for small teams
- Use Python & Bash for simple automation of security tasks like file monitoring and reporting
- Help improve digital hygience through password policies and access reviews

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks I Use

VS Code · Google Workspace · Python · Bash · Linux · Windows
NIST CSF · NIST 800-53 · CIS Controls · Risk Registers · Google Sheets/Docs
Chronicle · Splunk · Suricata · Wireshark · Tcpdump

---

### 🚀 Current Goal

Continue building hands-on GRC and cybersecurity projects while helping teams stay compliant, mitigate risk, and enhance operational security.
