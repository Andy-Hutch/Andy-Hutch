# 👋 Hi, I'm Andy Hutchison

I'm a GRC Analyst focused on Governance, Risk, and Compliance in cybersecurity. With a background in IT fundamentals and a growing portfolio of real-world projects, I specialize in helping organizations stay compliant, reduce risk, and improve their security posture.

---

### 🔐 What I Do

· Develop and implement security policies aligned with NIST and CIS frameworks
· Conduct internal audits and assess organizational risk using risk registers and control mapping
· Evaluate third-party vendors and create risk scoring models
· Design and deliver security awareness programs, including phishing simulations
· Automate tasks like file integrity checks, log parsing, and reporting with Python and Bash
· Promote digital hygiene through access reviews, password policies, and endpoint hardening

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks I Use

VS Code · Google Workspace · Python · Bash · Linux · Windows
NIST CSF · NIST 800-53 · CIS Controls · Risk Registers · Google Sheets/Docs
Chronicle · Splunk · Suricata · Wireshark · Tcpdump

---

### 🚀 Current Goal

I'm continuing to build hands-on experience through self-directed GRC and cybersecurity projects while preparing for Security+ certification. My goal is to contribute to teams that value security governance, compliance readiness, and risk-informed decision-making.
