## About Me
I'm Andy Hutchison — a former equipment operator and current Technicians Manager at Texaco, transitioning into the world of tech with a focus on UX/UI design.

Working in physically demanding roles taught me the value of efficiency, clear communication, and problem-solving under pressure — all of which translate surprisingly well into design. I realized I wanted to build more than just systems that move materials — I wanted to create digital experiences that move people.

My journey started with a deep dive into front-end development and user experience. I’ve been teaching myself tools like Figma, HTML, and Tailwind CSS, and learning how to design interfaces that are not only clean and accessible, but enjoyable to use.

Outside of work, I’m a proud dad, a hands-on learner, and someone who enjoys creative side projects, gaming, and anything that lets me build or optimize something new.

My goal? To craft intuitive, user-first designs that solve real-world problems and bring clarity to complex systems.

I have developed a cybersecurity portfolio showcasing various tasks and projects completed during my journey to earn the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. This program has provided insights into:
* Programming for cybersecurity tasks
* Frameworks and controls that inform security operations
* SIEM tools for cybersecurity
* Detecting and responding to incidents using an intrusion detection system
* Performing packet capture and analysis

Additionally, it has paved the way for me to pursue one of the entry-level following roles:
* Cybersecurity Analyst
* Security Analyst
* SOC Analyst
* Information Security Analyst
* IT Security Analyst
* Cyber Defense Analyst
