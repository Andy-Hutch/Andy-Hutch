# 🔐 Project 1: Access Control Policy Audit

**📌 Overview**

Led a simulated internal **access control audit** to evaluate the implementation of the **Principle of Least Privilege** and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. Developed a comprehensive **Access Control Policy**, created a detailed **role-access matrix**, and produced an **audit report** highlighting access risks and actionable improvements.
