# Controls and Compliance Assessment

## Overview
This project is a case study on conducting an internal IT audit for a fictional company, **Botium Toys**. The assessment evaluates the company's security posture, identifies risks, and ensures compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## Case Study Background
Botium Toys is a growing small business with a physical storefront and an expanding online presence. The IT department faces challenges in securing assets and ensuring compliance with regulations such as **PCI DSS** and **GDPR**. The IT manager has initiated an internal audit based on the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** to mitigate risks and improve security.

## Objectives
- Assess existing IT assets and controls.
- Complete a **Controls and Compliance Checklist**.
- Identify security gaps and provide recommendations for improvement.

## Scope
The audit covers **all assets** and **internal processes** related to security controls and compliance best practices at Botium Toys.

## Key Assessments
### **Risk Assessment**
